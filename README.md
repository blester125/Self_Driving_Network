# Self Driving Neural Network

A deep residual convolutional neural network that has been trained to produce steering angles 
with the udacity driving dataset

Data was extracted from ROSbag's using https://github.com/rwightman/udacity-driving-reader

Data is expected to be in ./data/output/[1-6]/center for images and ./data/output/[1-6]/interpolated.csv for steering angles

A quick example is shown here
